# `J`
## Compile and Execute Java "Scripts" in One Go!

![intro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qw3rtman/J/add-screenshots/screenshots/intro.png)

Java feels a bit clunky at times. **`J` is here to fix that.**

`J` **gives Java a *scripting* feel**. `J` **speeds up the development process** and saves you the trouble of running...

```sh
$ javac Sudoku.java
$ java Sudoku
```

...each time you modify the source code.

`J` was inspired by [`c`](https://github.com/ryanmjacobs/c), a wonderful project that allows you to "compile and execute C 'scripts' in one go!"


## Getting Started
After the [super painless drag-and-drop installation](#installation), you can [start using `J`](#usage) right away.

## Usage
### Compile and run Java source file
```sh
$ j Sudoku.java
```

Where `Sudoku.java` is the Java source file.

### Compile and run Java source file *with arguments*
```sh
$ j Sudoku.java Jack Jill
```

Where `Sudoku.java` is the Java source file. `Jack` and `Jill` are command line arguments (accessed with `args[0]` and `args[1]` in the main method of Sudoku.java).

## Installation
After downloading the Bash script, simply copy it over to your `$PATH` and you're good to go.
```sh
$ wget https://github.com/qw3rtman/j/releases/download/v0.1.0/j
$ chmod +x j
$ mv j /usr/local/bin
```

If you don't have `wget` on your system, you can download the `j` binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/qw3rtman/j/releases) and follow the above steps from the second one onward.

`J` (obviously) depends on Java (`java` and `javac`). Other than that, `J` has no dependencies!

## Updating
Simply follow the above steps and swap out the old Bash script with the new one!
